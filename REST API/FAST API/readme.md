This Folder discuss different concepts and explains overall the fastapi framework.


# FastAPI dependencies
FastAPI is dependent on three main libraries

- Pydantic
- Starlette
- Uvicorn


You will find different folders where I explain pydantic, Starlette and Uvicorn 
and then also inside the folder I will be discussing what functionality FASTAPI is using

From Pydantic: dataclasses, documentation (Swagger Auto generated)
Fom Starlette: Async, Middleware and a lot more.
From Uvicorn: accessing --reload and also deployment where the parallel API calls are being fetched.
